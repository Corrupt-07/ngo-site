                                    Poverty and malnutrition have always been a huge problem for India, especially in the rural areas and tribal belts. COVID-19 created an alarming situation for people who were already below the poverty line, as they did not have even odd jobs to work during this difficult time.
                                </p>
                                <p>We are making constant efforts to reach out to families in dire need with the help of our campaign, Garib Parivar Ration Yojana (GPRY). Under this campaign. we provide monthly ration to families that are associated with us every month. All these families are provided with Ration Cards, and they receive a grocery kit at the beginning of every month.</p>
                                <p>There are many families that need your help in these difficult time and we are putting in all possible efforts to help more and more such families throughout India. The Garib Parivar Ration Yojana provides underprivileged families with food supplies like wheat flour, pulses, cooking oil and spices, etc. Each family is provided with a monthly supply to ensure that no one in their families has to go to bed hungry. So far, we have distributed 38,268 ration kits all over the country.</p>

            <h1 class="text-center">TAX EXEMPTION ON DONATIONS UNDER SECTION 80G</h1>
            <p>A voluntary help, either in terms of money or kind, towards needy people, is known as charity. It not only makes you feel happy from within, but when you donate you can also save some tax.
            </p>
            <p>Today, there are various Non-Governmental Organisations (NGOs) and other non-profit bodies that collectively work towards conducting charitable activities that help them raise funds or non-monetary charity for people in need. Such institutions have put forth their best efforts that further play a significant role in promoting the various economic development and social welfare objectives that the Indian Government has initiated. The outreach and localised approach that NGOs and other non-profit entities follow has allowed for the identification of the needy and helps in ensuring that a supporting hand is provided to them. This is one of the key reasons why the Government of India offers tax incentives and exemptions to NGOs and charitable organisations with the exemptions under Section 80G of the Income Tax Act being the most significant ones.</p>
            <p>What is Tax Exemption?
                The reduction or removal of a liability to make a mandatory payment that is otherwise imposed by the ruling power on a property, individual, income, and so on, is known as tax exemption. Having a tax-exempt status may also provide relief from other taxes, offer reduced rates, or tax only on a portion of certain items. Exemption of tax for donations to charitable trusts and NGOs, from property and income taxes for veterans, cross-border scenarios, and so on, are some of the examples of tax exemption.</p>
